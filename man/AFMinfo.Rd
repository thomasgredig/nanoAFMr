\usage{
AFMinfo(filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Character scalar. Full path to the instrument AFM file.}
}
\value{
An object of class **`AFMinfo`** (list) with the following elements:
\itemize{
  \item `data` — instrument-specific header key/value table.
  \item `type` — character; inferred vendor type (`"Cypher"`, `"Park"`,
                `"NanoSurf"`, `"Veeco"`).
  \item `filename` — character; original file path.
  \item `imageSize.um` — numeric; scan size in micrometers (µm).
  \item `widthPixel` — numeric; number of pixels/samples in X.
  \item `heightPixel` — numeric; number of pixels/samples in Y.
  \item `scanRate.Hz` — numeric; line (or effective) scan rate in Hz.
  \item `scanAngle` — numeric; scan rotation angle in degrees.
  \item `imagingMode` — character; instrument imaging/operation mode.
  \item `cantilever` — character; cantilever or probe descriptor.
  \item `resFrequency` — numeric; resonance frequency in Hz (0 if unavailable).
  \item `noChannels` — integer; number of data channels detected.
  \item `note` — character; free-form note (instrument dependent).
}
}
\description{
Parses instrument-specific headers and returns a compact summary of AFM scan
settings. Numeric outputs are coerced into consistent base units:

- `imageSize.um` in micrometers (µm)

- `scanRate.Hz` in hertz (Hz)

- `resFrequency` in hertz (Hz)

- `scanAngle` in degrees
}
\details{
Read and normalize header/metadata from AFM image files produced by several
instrument vendors (Asylum/Cypher `.ibw`, Park `.tiff`, Nanosurf `.nid`,
and Bruker/Veeco Nanoscope). The function extracts commonly used fields such
as scan size, pixel dimensions, scan angle, scan rate, imaging mode,
cantilever information, and resonance frequency, and returns them in a
consistent structure with standardized units.


**Supported formats and field mapping (high level):**
- **Asylum/Cypher (`.ibw`)**: Reads fields such as `ScanSize`, `PointsLines`,
  `ScanLines`, `ScanAngle`, `ScanRate`, `ImagingMode`, `ThermalLever`,
  `ResFreq1`, `ImageNote`, `BaseName`. The image size is converted to µm,
  resonance frequency to Hz.
- **Park (`.tiff`)**: Reads `dfXScanSizeum`, `nWidth`, `nHeight`, `dfAngle`,
  `dfScanRateHz`, `imageMode`, `Cantilever`, `dfNCMFrequency`, `sourceName`.
  Image size is provided directly in µm; frequencies are normalized to Hz.
- **Nanosurf (`.nid`)**: Uses `get_NID_imageSize()` to derive scan size (µm),
  reads `Points`, `Lines`, `Rotation` (parsed as degrees), `Time/Line`
  (converted to `scanRate.Hz = 1 / (time per line)`), `Op. mode`,
  `Cantilever type`, `Vibration freq` (kHz → Hz). Channel count is inferred
  from `Gr\\d-Ch\\d` entries.
- **Bruker/Veeco Nanoscope (other)**: Reads `Scan size`, valid data lengths,
  `Feature scan angle`, `Scan rate`, and misc. notes. Image size is expressed
  in µm. Some fields may be instrument/firmware dependent.

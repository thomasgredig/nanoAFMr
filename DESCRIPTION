Description: Import and graph atomic force microscopy (AFM) image files 
    for analysis. The supported file formats include NanoSurf NID
    files, Bruker and VEECO NanoScope files, Park AFM files, and Asylum 
    Research Igor wavefiles. It supports image flattening, height-height 
    correlation function analysis, line profiles, and other basic data analysis. 
    It supports analysis of spectroscopy data for Park AFM files. This material is based
